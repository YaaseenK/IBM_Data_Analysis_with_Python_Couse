# Statistics for Data Science - Study Guide

## 1. Introduction to Statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions.

**Example:** A company analyzing customer feedback to improve their product.

---

## 2. Types of Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizes and organizes data.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Draws conclusions from a sample to make predictions about a population.

**Example:** Finding the average exam score (descriptive) vs. predicting next year's scores based on this year's data (inferential).

---

## 3. Data Types
- **Qualitative (Categorical):** Names or labels (e.g., colors, gender).
- **Quantitative (Numerical):** Measurable quantities (e.g., height, weight).
- **Nominal:** Categories with no order (e.g., eye color).
- **Ordinal:** Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., ranking in a race).
- **Interval:** Ordered with equal spacing but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
- **Ratio:** Ordered with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).

**Example:** The temperature (interval) vs. the number of students in a class (ratio).

---

## 4. Frequency Distribution
Organizes data into tables or graphs showing the number of occurrences.

**Example:** A histogram showing the number of students scoring within different grade ranges.

---

## 5. Measures of Central Tendency
- **Mean (Average):** Sum of all values divided by count.
- **Median:** Middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value.

**Example:** Exam scores of {55, 60, 65, 65, 70, 75, 80}
- Mean = (55+60+65+65+70+75+80)/7 = 67
- Median = 65
- Mode = 65

---

## 6. Measures of Dispersion
- **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest values.
- **Variance:** Average squared deviation from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance.

**Example:** {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} has a range of 8 (10-2).

---

## 7. Five Number Summary & Box Plot
- Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum.
- Box plots visualize data spread and identify outliers.

**Example:** {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} â†’ Five-number summary: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

---

## 8. Correlation
Measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables (-1 to +1).

**Example:** Ice cream sales and temperature have a positive correlation.

---

## 9. Probability
The likelihood of an event occurring (0 to 1).

**Example:** Rolling a die: P(rolling a 4) = 1/6.

---

## 10. Normal Distribution & Empirical Rule
- Bell-shaped curve.
- **Empirical Rule:** 68% (1 SD), 95% (2 SD), 99.7% (3 SD).

**Example:** Heights of people often follow a normal distribution.

---

## 11. Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No effect.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Some effect.
- **p-value:** Probability of observing results under H0.

**Example:** Testing if a new drug is more effective than the current one.

---

## 12. Lab Sessions & Practical Applications
Applying concepts to real-world datasets using Python, Excel, or R.

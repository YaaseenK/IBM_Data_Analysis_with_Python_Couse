# Data Types in Statistics - Notes

## 📌 Introduction
Understanding different data types is crucial in statistics and data science, as they determine how data is analyzed and interpreted.

## 🏷️ Types of Data
### 1. **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**
   - Describes characteristics, labels, or attributes.
   - Cannot be measured numerically.
   
   #### **Subtypes:**
   - **Nominal Data**: No inherent order (e.g., gender, colors, names).
   - **Ordinal Data**: Ordered categories (e.g., survey ratings: satisfied, neutral, unsatisfied).
   
   **Example:**
   - A dataset containing "Yes/No" responses or a list of car brands.

### 2. **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**
   - Represents measurable quantities.
   
   #### **Subtypes:**
   - **Interval Data**: Ordered with meaningful differences but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
   - **Ratio Data**: Ordered, meaningful differences, and a true zero (e.g., weight, height, income).
   
   **Example:**
   - Student exam scores (Ratio) or temperature readings (Interval).

## 📊 **Discrete vs. Continuous Data**
### 1. **Discrete Data**
   - Countable, finite values (e.g., number of students in a class).
   
   **Example:**
   - A shop tracking the number of daily customers (1, 2, 3...)

### 2. **Continuous Data**
   - Infinite values within a range (e.g., weight, time, height).
   
   **Example:**
   - A person’s weight measured as 72.5 kg.

## 📌 **Data Attributes**
- Data attributes describe characteristics of a dataset.
- Examples: Age, job title, income level, marital status.

**Example:**
- A dataset for predicting loan default includes attributes like customer age, employment status, and loan amount.

## ✅ **Conclusion**
Understanding data types helps in selecting the right statistical methods and machine learning models. It is essential for accurate data analysis and meaningful insights.

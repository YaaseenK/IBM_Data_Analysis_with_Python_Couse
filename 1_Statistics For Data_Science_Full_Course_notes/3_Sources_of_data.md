## ðŸ“Š Sources of Data
### **1. Primary Data**
- Collected firsthand by organizations or researchers.
- **Examples:**
  - Customer feedback surveys.
  - Banking transaction records.
  - Company-owned databases.

### **2. Secondary Data**
- Obtained from external sources.
- **Examples:**
  - Government reports.
  - Public datasets from research institutions.
  - Third-party data providers (e.g., industry reports).

## ðŸ“Œ Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
### **1. Descriptive Statistics**
- Summarizes and describes data.
- **Examples:**
  - Average income of a cityâ€™s residents.

### **1. Population**
- The entire set of data points under study.
- **Example:** All residents of a country.

### **2. Sample**
- A subset of the population used for analysis.
- **Example:** A survey conducted in select cities to estimate nationwide preferences.

## ðŸ“Œ Parameter vs. Statistic
### **1. Parameter**
- A numerical value describing a population.
- **Example:** The true average height of all students in a school.

### **2. Statistic**
- A numerical value derived from a sample.
- **Example:** The average height of a sample of 200 students from a school.

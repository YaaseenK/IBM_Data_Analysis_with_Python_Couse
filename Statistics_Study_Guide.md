# Statistics for Data Science - Study Guide

## 1. Introduction to Statistics

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions.

**Example:** A company analyzing customer feedback to improve their product.

---

## 2. Types of Statistics

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizes and organizes data.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Draws conclusions from a sample to make predictions about a population.

**Example:** Finding the average exam score (descriptive) vs. predicting next year's scores based on this year's data (inferential).

**Visualization:** Bar charts, histograms, and summary tables.

---

## 3. Data Types

- **Qualitative (Categorical):** Names or labels (e.g., colors, gender).
- **Quantitative (Numerical):** Measurable quantities (e.g., height, weight).
- **Nominal:** Categories with no order (e.g., eye color).
- **Ordinal:** Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., ranking in a race).
- **Interval:** Ordered with equal spacing but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).
- **Ratio:** Ordered with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).

**Example:** The temperature (interval) vs. the number of students in a class (ratio).

**Visualization:** Pie charts, bar charts, scatter plots.

---

## 4. Sources of Data

- **Primary Data:** Collected firsthand (e.g., surveys, experiments).
- **Secondary Data:** Collected by others (e.g., government reports, published datasets).

**Example:** A company conducting customer surveys (primary) vs. using census data (secondary).

**Visualization:** Data tables and metadata documentation.

---

## 5. Population vs. Sample

- **Population:** The entire group being studied.
- **Sample:** A subset of the population used to make inferences.

**Example:** Studying all university students (population) vs. surveying 500 students (sample).

**Visualization:** Venn diagrams, sampling distribution graphs.

---

## 6. Parameter vs. Statistic

- **Parameter:** A numerical value describing a population.
- **Statistic:** A numerical value describing a sample.

**Example:** The average income of all employees in a company (parameter) vs. the average income from a surveyed group (statistic).

**Visualization:** Frequency distributions, summary statistics tables.

---

## 7. Frequency Distribution

Organizes data into tables or graphs showing the number of occurrences.

**Example:** A histogram showing the number of students scoring within different grade ranges.

**Visualization:** Histograms, bar charts, frequency tables.

---

## 8. Measures of Central Tendency

- **Mean (Average):** Sum of all values divided by count.
- **Median:** Middle value when data is sorted.
- **Mode:** Most frequently occurring value.

**Example:** Exam scores of {55, 60, 65, 65, 70, 75, 80}

- Mean = (55+60+65+65+70+75+80)/7 = 67
- Median = 65
- Mode = 65

**Visualization:** Box plots, stem-and-leaf plots.

---

## 9. Measures of Dispersion

- **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest values.
- **Variance:** Average squared deviation from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation:** Square root of variance.

**Example:** {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} has a range of 8 (10-2).

**Visualization:** Box plots, standard deviation plots.

---

## 10. Five Number Summary & Box Plot

- Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum.
- Box plots visualize data spread and identify outliers.

**Example:** {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} â†’ Five-number summary: (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

**Visualization:** Box plots, whisker plots.

---

## 11. Correlation

Measures the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables (-1 to +1).

**Example:** Ice cream sales and temperature have a positive correlation.

**Visualization:** Scatter plots, correlation matrices.

---

## 12. Probability

The likelihood of an event occurring (0 to 1).

**Example:** Rolling a die: P(rolling a 4) = 1/6.

**Visualization:** Probability trees, Venn diagrams.

---

## 13. Normal Distribution & Empirical Rule

- Bell-shaped curve.
- **Empirical Rule:** 68% (1 SD), 95% (2 SD), 99.7% (3 SD).

**Example:** Heights of people often follow a normal distribution.

**Visualization:** Bell curves, normal probability plots.

---

## 14. Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No effect.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Some effect.
- **p-value:** Probability of observing results under H0.

**Example:** Testing if a new drug is more effective than the current one.

**Visualization:** p-value charts, hypothesis testing decision trees.

---

## 15. Lab Sessions & Practical Applications

Applying concepts to real-world datasets using Python, Excel, or R.

**Visualization:** Real-world datasets, hands-on exercises.
